## Generating Functions

- Motivation of considering generating functions.

**Definition 1**     
The _generating function for the sequence $a_0$, $a_1$, $\ldots$, $a_k$, $\ldots$ of real numbers is the infinite series
$$
  G(x) = a_0 x + a_1 + \ldots + a_k x^k + \ldots
    \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k
$$
