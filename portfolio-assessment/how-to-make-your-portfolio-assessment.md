# Rules for portfolio assessment

To write any assignment, you need to follow strictly to all these rules.

1. Prepare a sheet of A4 paper. 
   Draw a margin with the size 1 cm around all the edges

   <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; width:100%">
   <div style="border: 2px solid black; background-color:gray">
    <div style="width:300px; height:400px; border:1px solid black; margin: 20px">
      <div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between">
        <span>Full Name</span>  
        <span>DD/Mmm/YYYY</span>
      </div> 
      <span>Student ID</span>
    </div>
   </div>
   </div>

   Write your name and the student ID number as shown in the above figure.   
   You may include the date to the top right of your paper.
   You can use both sides of the paper.   
   Make sure to draw also the margin. If you submit your answer more than one sheets, please write the page number.   

   **You have to write your answers with a pen!**

   **Special case**: If you want to use 2-hole binder for organizing your
   writing, set the left margin into 1.5cm or 2cm (depending on your binder).
   Remember your binder must be accomodate A4 paper!

   strikethrough the words or sentences. Or you can throw away the paper
   and start out from the beginning.

3. In each week, you have to write at least two sheets (on both sides).
   Your portfolio assessment must contain the following parts
   - your notes during a class, and
   - three problems (easy, medium, and hard).   
     These level of difficulties are depending on your understanding
     and how long can you solved the problem.
     You have to write those three problems and also their answers.

     Easy problem can be solved around 5 minutes    
     Medium problem can be solved around 15 minutes    
     Hard problem can be solved around 40 minutes or more.

   For the problems, you can choose the problems from (Rosen, 2019)
   or use from the recitations.

   At the end of the semester, you will accumulate at least 28 sheets.

   colored ballpoints or markers.
