expansion of $(2 x^3 - 4 y^2)^7$, where

<ol type="a">
  <li> 

  $a = 9$, $b = 8$.
  <li>

  $a = 8$, $b = 9$.
  <li>

  $a = 0$, $b = 14$.
  <li>

  $a = 12$, $b = 6$.
  <li>

  $a = 18$, $b = 2$.
</ol>

**Solution**: 


## Problem 09

Suppose that $k$ and $n$ are integers with $1 \leq k < n$. Prove the
**hexagon identity**

$$
  \binom{n-1}{k-1} \binom{n}{k+1} \binom{n+1}{k}
    = \binom{n-1}{k} \binom{n}{k-1} \binom{n+1}{k+1}
$$
which relates terms in Pascal's triangle that form a hexagon.

one unit in the positive $y$ direction, or one unit in the positive $z$
direction? (Moving in the negative $x$, $y$, and $z$ direction is prohibited, 
so that no backtracking is allowed.)
