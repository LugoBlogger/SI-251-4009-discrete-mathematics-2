## Problem 01

Determine whether the graphs shown above ($G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$, $G_4$, $G_5$, 
$G_6$, and $G_7$) has directed or undirected edges, whether it has 
multiple edges, and whether it has one or more loops. Use your answer 
to determine the type of graph according to the classification
that you have learned during the class.

**Solution**: 


## Problem 02

For each undirected graph in the above graphs that is not simple, 
find a set of edges to remove to make it simple.

_Hint_: You can use a pair of two vertices for naming the edges, 
or you can add your own label to name the edge.

**Solution**: 


## Problem 03

The **intersection graph** is a collection of sets $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$
is a graph that has a vertex for of these sets and has an edge connecting
the vertices representing two sets if these sets have a nonempty intersection.
Construct the intersection graph of these collections of sets.

<ol type="a">
<li>

$A_1 = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$, $A_2 = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$,   
$A_3 = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$, $A_4 = \{5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$,  
$A_5 = \{0, 1, 8, 9\}$
<li>

$A_1 = \{\ldots, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0\}$,   
$A_2 = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$,    
$A_3 = \{\ldots, -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots\}$    
$A_4 = \{\ldots, -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, \ldots\}$   
$A_5 = \{\ldots, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots\}$
<li>

$A_1 = \{x \mid x < 0\}$,    
$A_2 = \{x \mid -1 < x < 0\}$,    
$A_3 = \{x \mid 0 < x < 1\}$,    
$A_4 = \{x \mid -1 < x < 1\}$,    
$A_5 = \{x \mid x > -1\}$,    
$A_6 = \mathbb{R}$
